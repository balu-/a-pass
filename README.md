## Features

### üîê You own your data!
Ownership of your data is important, especially when it comes to passwords and other secrets. 
We believe that this is only possible if the software that stores it runs on your machine and keeps your data there. 
You may decide to sync and/or backup data to other places but we feel that you can only rely on a password manager that is able to fulfill its job offline.
\
**We call it the local first approach.**

### üîê Strong & open security by default
We are commited to keep your passwords secure, therefor 
APass is based on strong and open cryptography[^1], 
so you can trust and rely on it.
The way in which your secrets are cryped will be documented so your secrets can be restored even without APass.

### üîê Powerfull & Configurable Password-Generator
APass has a powerfull password-generator on board.
