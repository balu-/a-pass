# A-Pass

Apass a Password-Manager based on strong and open cryptography[^1],
\
so _you_ only have to remember a single password and your the only one with acces to your secrets.
It has a powerfull & configurable password-generator so all the sometimes stupid password restrictions can be met.
It is based on strong and open security by default so you can trust and rely on it. 
The way in which your secrets are cryped is documented so your secrets can be restored even without APass.
Its your data, and yours only. Ownership of your data is important, especially when it comes to passwords and other secrets. 
We believe that this is only possible if the software that stores it runs on your machine and keeps your data there. 
You may decide to sync and/or backup data to other places but we feel that you can only rely on a password manager that is able to fulfill its job offline. We call it the local first approach.
